Real-time magnetic resonance imaging captured midsagittal vocal tract configurations. Eight morphological measures were analyzed: lip opening, jaw opening, jaw protrusion, tongue dorsum height, uvula elevation, oropharyngeal opening, laryngeal height, and laryngeal tilt. Linear mixed-effects modeling explored relation - ships between vocal qualities and anatomical measurements. Results. Lip opening, jaw opening, oropharyngeal opening, and laryngeal height showed significant differ - ences across vocal qualities. The traditional/legit voice quality demonstrated the smallest lip, jaw, and or- opharyngeal openings with the lowest laryngeal position. Rock belt showed the largest lip and jaw openings. Brassy belt and rock belt featured larger oropharyngeal space and higher tongue positions than other qualities, creating a “tube-like” shape rather than the previously suggested megaphone shape. Laryngeal positioning was elevated in all belting styles, but not in traditional/legit. No significant differences were found between male and female participants. Lower pitch tasks were characterized by smaller lip, jaw, and oropharyngeal openings comp\n"

To identify vocal tract configuration patterns in vocally healthy con- temporary commercial music (CCM) singers during the production of five industry-typical vocal qualities, including various belting qualities and traditional/legit musical theater singing. Study Design. Prospective, observational study. Methods. Seven professional musical theater singers (four females, three males) performed arpeggiated pat- terns using five different vocal qualities: traditional/legit, neutral belt, brassy belt, warm belt, and rock belt. Real-time magnetic resonance imaging captured midsagittal vocal tract configurations. Eight morphological measures were analyzed: lip opening, jaw opening, jaw protrusion, tongue dorsum height, uvula elevation, oropharyngeal opening, laryngeal height, and laryngeal tilt. Linear mixed-effects modeling explored relation - ships between vocal qualities and anatomical measurements. Results. Lip opening, jaw opening, oropharyngeal opening, and laryngeal height showed significant differ - ences across vocal qualities. The traditional/legit voice quality demonstrated the smallest lip, jaw, and or- opharyngeal openings with the lowest laryngeal position. Rock belt showed the largest lip and jaw openings. Brassy belt and rock belt featured larger oropharyngeal space and higher tongue positions than other qualities, creating a “tube-like” shape rather than the previously suggested megaphone shape. Laryngeal positioning was elevated in all belting styles, but not in traditional/legit. No significant differences were found between male and female participants. Lower pitch tasks were characterized by smaller lip, jaw, and oropharyngeal openings comp'}]\n",
